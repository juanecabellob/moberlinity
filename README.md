# Moberlinity

Moberlinity simulates a carsharing environment in a city. Random places, citizens and vehicles scattered around an area of a city are generated and in the course of two hours of a given time of a day a probable activity can be observed. 

> WARNING: Don't rely on this code yet as it still is WIP. The master it's not sacred yet (every commit still goes into master) and there is no test environment so there is no warranty that everything is running bug-free.

## How to use it

Clone this repository or download it as .zip files and open the `index.html` file.

To adapt the area in which the citizens, places and vehicles are generated, hover the central marker and scroll up to increase the area or down to decrease it. 

To change the location, just click wherever on the map and the central marker will update.

To start a simulation just click on the button located in the bottom-right corner. 

## Remarks

Currently, the time scala used is 100:1, meaning that a second is being represented as a centisecond, to avoid long running scripts that go over an hour.

If you feel like contributing, please feel free to contact me. At the moment the code is still in a messy state and it's still WIP.
